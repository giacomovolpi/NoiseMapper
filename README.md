# NoiseMapper
NoiseMapper is an Android application that allows users to map noise levels in their environment. The app uses the device's microphone to record noise levels, proximity sensor for detecting when the phohe is in your pocket and BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons to record the location of the noise. The app also allows users to view the noise levels on a map and filter the noise levels by date. The app is designed to help users identify areas with high noise levels and take action to reduce noise pollution. We used Kontakt.io beacons to understand the device location. We also include a server to store and retrieve noise measurements and configuration file. The app is designed with energy efficiency in mind and uses batch updates and power governor to reduce battery consumption in case of low battery/power saving mode.

## Requirements
